      was close to despair. He had gambled his 
      considerable fortune on oil, and now he 
      was on the verge of losing it all. It 
      seemed that the geologists and experts 
      who had wagged their heads encouragingly 
      at him since 1901.`,

    description: `Having never set foot in Persia himself, 
      Mr D'Arcy didn't even have adventure travel 
      stories to show for his investment. What 
      he had was letters and telegrams from his 
      explorer, urging patience, practically 
      begging to extend the search.`,

      whose investment had saved the expedition

      character, even if he might admit that this 
      particular search had often seemed doomed. 
      It had taken 10 days just to get to 
      Shardin, eight months to start drilling 
      and six years of toiling to find nothing

      fallen off in one of two last-chance wells

      early morning of 26 May 1908, the whole 
      camp reeked of sulphur. At four o'clock 
      the drill reached 1,180 feet and a fountain
